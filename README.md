# Log-Classification-System
This project implements a hybrid log classification system that categorizes system, application, and CRM logs using Regex, BERT embeddings, and LLMs. It classifies logs into categories like user actions, workflow errors, system notifications, and deprecation warnings to support monitoring, alerting, and analytics.
